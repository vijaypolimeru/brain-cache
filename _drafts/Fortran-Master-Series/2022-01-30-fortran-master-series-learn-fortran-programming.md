Tooo succesfully master nonlinear finite element programming in OpenSees, it is very essential to learn (or master) either Fortran or Python. Because, Fortran and Python are
the only mainstream interpreters available for modelling structres in OpenSees. In the current scenario, it is very easy to get a resource (books, video tutorials, 
blogs etc.) for learning Python, as it is dominating the world of computer programming. But this is not the case with Fortran, getting a good 
introductory resource for Fortran is a daunting task. 

Hence to help upcoming finite element modellers in OpenSees, this ***Fortran Master Series*** has been started. 
Wherein we will provide all the 
essential concepts (from the standpoint of linear algebra and Fortranlib with relevant examples) 
required to create elegant finite element models, which are *easy to read and debug* in Fortran for OpenSees.

The list of topics which we will cover in this series are as follows,

2. [Setting up essential tools (such as compiler, IDE)]()
3. Programming Concepts
	1. [Basic Information about Fortran Programming]()
	3. [if...elseif....else]()
	4. [Loops]()
	5. [Arrays]()
	6. [Lists]()
	8. [Dictionraies]()
	9. [Procedures]()
	11. [File Management]()
	12. [Exception Handling]()
4. [Various Useful Codes and Procs](/some-useful-codes-learn-Fortran-programming-from-scratch/)

## Learning Resources

### Books 

1. [Book 1]()
2. [Book 2]()

### Web Courses

1. [Source 1]()
2. [Source 2]()
3. [Source 3]()

This is an Open-Source course primarily devoted to Fortran, none of the OpenSees commands will be discussed here.
As of now this series is in development stage, 
please do watch frequently for latest updates or sign-up [here](https://forms.gle/c7v6atfcLwcQgEE28), I will notify you when ever there is a major update.
