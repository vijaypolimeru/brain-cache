By not turning on your camera for a video call, you're basically saying "I can't be bothered to get dressed, 
the extra layer of communication video adds is not worth the effort because this meeting and you aren't important enough."

A former boss once told me, and I disagreed with him at the time, that ***you don't dress for yourself, 
you dress for other people - your 'level' of dress is a sign of how important the person you're meeting is to you.***

It's the same with your camera - turning it on so the other person can see you is a sign of respect to them.

You'd dress well for an interview, right? And you'd turn on your camera if it was on Zoom? 
That's because you're showing your respect, you're showing you've made the effort.

Now, sure, there are good reasons and occasions to not show your face in a video call - 
in particular, it can be tough at times for parents - but in general, not having your 
camera on for work video calls is a bit like turning up to work in your pyjamas.

Take every opportunity to connect and interact with your colleagues - and show the team you respect them and have made the effort.
