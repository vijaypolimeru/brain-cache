## _PREFACE_
1. We live in a culture that promotes democratic values of being fair to one and all, the importance of fitting into a group, and knowing how to cooperate with other people. We are taught early on in life that those who are outwardly combative and aggressive pay a social price: unpopularity and isolation.
1. The problem for us is that we are trained and prepared for peace, and we are not at all prepared for what confronts us in the real world--war.
1. In politics, business, even the arts, we face opponents who will do almost anything to gain an edge
1. It is not that we and our colleagues are ignoble creatures who fail to live up to ideals of peace and selflessness, but that we cannot help the way we are. We have aggressive impulses that are impossible to ignore or repress
1. And this knowledge is not about how to be more forceful in getting what we want or defending ourselves but rather how to be more rational and strategic when it comes to conflict, channeling our aggressive impulses instead of denying or repressing them.
1. This ideal of fighting rationally comes to us from organized warfare, where the art of strategy was invented and refined. In the beginning, war was not at all strategic. Battles between tribes were fought in a brutal manner, a kind of ritual of violence in which individuals could display their heroism. But as tribes expanded and evolved into states, it became all too apparent that war had too many hidden costs, that waging it blindly often led to exhaustion and self-destruction, even for the victor. Somehow wars had to be fought more rationally.
1. The self is the friend of a man who masters himself through the self, but for a man without self-mastery, the self is like an enemy at war. - THE BHAGAVAD GITA, INDIA, CIRCA A.D. FIRST CENTURY
1. *War and strategy have an inexorable logic: if you want or desire anything, you must be ready and able to fight for it.*
1. The following are six fundamental ideals you should aim for in transforming yourself into a strategic warrior in daily life.
	1. Look at things as they are, not as your emotions color them.
	1. Judge people by their actions.
	1. Depend on your own arms.
	1. Worship Athena, not Ares
	1. Elevate yourself above the battlefield
	1. Spiritualize your warfare
1. As a warrior in life, you welcome combat and conflict as ways to prove yourself, to better your skills, to gain courage, confidence, and experience. Instead of repressing your doubts and fears, you must face them down, do battle with them. You want more challenges, and you invite more war. You are forging the warrior's spirit, and only constant practice will lead you there.
1. **The book is divided into five parts: self-directed war (how to prepare your mind and spirit for battle); 
organizational war (how to structure and motivate your army); defensive war; offensive war; 
and unconventional (dirty) war. Each chapter is illustrated with historical examples, 
not only from warfare itself but from politics (Margaret Thatcher), culture (Alfred Hitchcock), 
sports (Muhammad Ali), business (John D. Rockefeller), showing the intimate connection between the military and the social. 
These strategies can be applied to struggles of every scale: organized warfare, business battles, the politics of a group, even personal relationships.**
1. Events in life mean nothing if you do not reflect on them in a deep way, and ideas from books are pointless if they have no application to life as you live it.
1. What you know must translate into action, and action must translate into knowledge.
