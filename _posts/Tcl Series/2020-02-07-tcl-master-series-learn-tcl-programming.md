To succesfully master nonlinear finite element programming in OpenSees, it is very essential to learn (or master) either Tcl or Python. Because, Tcl and Python are
the only mainstream interpreters available for modelling structres in OpenSees. In the current scenario, it is very easy to get a resource (books, video tutorials, 
blogs etc.) for learning Python, as it is dominating the world of computer programming. But this is not the case with Tcl, getting a good 
introductory resource for Tcl is a daunting task. 

Though there are some good resources for learning Tcl (such as 
[Tcl/Tk course on Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tcl-tk/index.htm), 
[Tcl and the Tk Toolkit book](https://www.amazon.in/Tcl-Tk-Toolkit-2e-Ousterhout/dp/8131734870/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A38RCVK1TN7G&keywords=tcl+and+the+tk+toolkit&qid=1585046094&sprefix=tcl+and+the+tk+%2Caps%2C997&sr=8-1), 
and more (given a the end of this post)), 
there are no courses which introduce Tcl from the standpoint of matrix and vector operations (Linear Algebra in general) and 
standard Tcl library (Tcllib), which are very
essential for engineers, particulary finite element modellers in OpenSees. 

Hence to help upcoming finite element modellers in OpenSees, this ***Tcl Master Series*** has been started. 
Wherein we will provide all the 
essential concepts (from the standpoint of linear algebra and Tcllib with relevant examples) 
required to create elegant finite element models, which are *easy to read and debug* in Tcl for OpenSees.

The list of topics which we will cover in this series are as follows,

2. Setting up essential tools (such as Tcl compiler, IDE) 
3. Programming Concepts
	1. [Basic Information about Tcl Programming](/basic-information-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	3. [if...elseif....else](/conditionals-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	4. [Loops](/loops-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	5. [Arrays](/arrays-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	6. [Lists](/lists-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	8. [Dictionraies](/dict-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	9. [Procedures](/procedures-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	11. [File Management](/file-management-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	12. [Exception Handling](/exception-handling-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
	10. Standard Tcl Library (Tcllib)
		1. [Installation](/tcllib-installation-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)
		2. [Examples](/tcllib-examples-learn-tcl-programming-from-scratch/)

## Learning Resources

### Books 

1. [Tcl and the Tk Toolkit by John K. Ousterhout and Ken Jones](https://www.amazon.in/Tcl-Tk-Toolkit-2e-Ousterhout/dp/8131734870/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=tcl%2Ftk+books&qid=1585112979&sr=8-1)
2. [Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk by Brent B. Welch and Ken Jones](https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Programming-Tcl-Brent-Welch/dp/0130385603/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=tcl%2Ftk+books&qid=1585112979&sr=8-7)

### Web Courses

1. [Tcl/Tk by TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tcl-tk/index.htm)
2. [Standard Tcl Library (Tcllib) Documentation](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib/doc/trunk/embedded/md/toc.md)
3. [Komodo IDE Documentation](http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/11/)

This is an Open-Source course primarily devoted to Tcl, none of the OpenSees commands will be discussed here.
As of now this series is in development stage, 
please do watch frequently for latest updates or sign-up [here](https://forms.gle/c7v6atfcLwcQgEE28), I will notify you when ever there is a major update.
