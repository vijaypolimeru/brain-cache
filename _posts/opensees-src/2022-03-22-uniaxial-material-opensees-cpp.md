Thanks to the [OpenSees Developers and Maintainers](https://github.com/OpenSees/OpenSees/graphs/contributors) for contributing and opensourcing such a powerful software.
As on today (2020-03-22) OpenSees consists of,

1. 9 steel and reinforcing material models
1. 10 concrete materials
1. 47 Other  uniaxial material models including some standard materials

There is no other commercial/opensource software in the world for structural engineers, which consists of these many nonlinear material 
models for concrete and steel. Few factors responsible for this phenomenal evolution of OpenSees are,

1. Interpreters - There are innumberable [finite element softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finite_element_software_packages) in the world, 
outof which for many of them are proprietary (source code is not available) and the remaining opensource softwares are not for all. 
1. Examples
