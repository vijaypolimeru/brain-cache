In this post, I have covered some of the best tracks for running/jogging at IIT Bombay. The distance of tracks ranges from, as short as 0.4 Km (3 mins approx) to 6.0 Km (30 min approx).
Choose the path depending on your time goals.  

The total distance shown in the figures is measured using google maps, 
I guess slopes are excluded in GMaps, hence there might be $$ \pm 10\% $$ error (approximately).

Track 1

I guess, this track does not need an introdcution. This is the running/jogging track in IITB-Gymkhana grounds.

Track 2

This route starts from Hostel 12/13/14 bus stop to Main gate (via Main road), without any major turns.

Track 3

This route starts from Hostel 12/13/14 bus stop to the tree before Padmavati temple, (via lake side road).

![route-1]({{ '/images/fitness/route-3.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Track 4

This track is the road surrounding gymkhana grounds. 

![route-1]({{ '/images/fitness/route-4.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Track 5

This track is preferable for long distance running. This one starts
at the T-Junction near campus hub --> tree before padmavati temple (via lake side road) --> Directors Bungalow --> H10 --> Main gate --> YP gate --> CSRE Building
--> QIP Quarters --> Hostel 15 --> Old SAC --> and ends at T-Junction near campus hub
